PeanutFactory
=============

I'm learning a language called [rPeANUt](http://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/COMP2300/rpeanut.html) while taking COMP2300 at the ANU, and I decided that writing an implementation of it in Python would help me learn it, as well as be an interesting learning experience by itself - I have never written a microprocessor simulator. Stay tuned, folks.
